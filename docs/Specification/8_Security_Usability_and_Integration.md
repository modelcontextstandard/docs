# 8 · Security, Usability and Integration

A central goal of the Model Context Standard (MCS) is to connect LLMs to external systems directly and minimally. Unlike MCP, MCS avoids a custom protocol, relying on mature technologies like HTTP, OpenAPI, or Docker that are already proven secure. This eliminates many potential attack surfaces typical of new standards.

MCP's STDIO transport enforces an autostart mechanism, running server processes in the background with user privileges. This creates a high entry barrier for less technical users (who must provide and secure the execution environment) and poses security risks. Protection depends entirely on the server implementation. A malicious MCP server could execute arbitrary actions in the user's context, especially without virtualization or safeguards.

MCS carries a similar risk of malicious drivers from untrusted sources, but lacks MCP's additional protocol vulnerabilities, since no such protocol exists. MCS addresses trust more directly. Each driver has a unique ID, is distributed via established package managers like PyPI, and can be secured prospectively with signed checksums or central registries. This makes origin and integrity verifiable, similar to package checksums in Linux or artifact checks in Maven environments. Starting with default repositories and naming conventions defined by MCS SDKs for each language ensures consistent, auditable distribution. Later such a central registry could be used to verify the integrity of the driver and support autoloading.

Usability benefits directly. For REST over HTTP, users simply provide an OpenAPI URL, the driver auto-detects functions, generates prompts, and provides execution mechanisms. Neither client developers nor end-users need to handle technical details or prompt knowledge. Developers can reuse existing REST endpoints and integrate new interfaces into projects or toolchains without extra effort.

An optional autostart remains possible but is not mandatory. The reference architecture uses a mixin model for Docker container starts: The driver defines container setup, while users ideally just specify the image name. This is safer than starting local server processes and simpler to handle. Users also gain from central Docker repositories for verifiable image origin and integrity.

MCS complements MCP rather than replacing it, approaching LLM-external system binding from a different angle. Both concepts can be used together: Existing MCP servers integrate seamlessly via MCS drivers (e.g., MCP-over-STDIO or MCP-over-SSE), reusing solutions without client changes. Conversely, MCP servers can use MCS drivers—especially ToolDrivers—with a single MCS-compatible MCP implementation bridging all MCS drivers into the MCP ecosystem.

MCS combines modular drivers with established standards, enhancing security, reducing unnecessary complexity, and creating an open foundation for seamless LLM integration across diverse system landscapes.
